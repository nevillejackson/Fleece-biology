     Parameter & Model Description  &  Biological Interpretation  \\ 
\hline 
  $D_{0}$  &  Diameter of the cylinder  &  Internal diameter of the follicle wall or outer root sheath \\
  $\gamma$ &  Proportion of the glass beads which do not adhere to the wall of the cylinder  &  Proportion of the cortical cells which form the fibre, rather than the inner root sheath \\
 $\lambda$ &  Degree to which glass beads expand lengthwise & degree to which cortical cells which enter the fibre cortex expand in length during differentiation \\
 $V_{0}$   &  Volume of glass beads poured into the cylinder & Volume of cells produced by mitoses in the follicle bulb per unit time. Involves the number of basal cells in the bulb, the mitotic rate, and the average cell size before differentiation. \\
