# Fleece-biology #
This project is about understanding  development of the skin , growth of wool fibres and formation of a fleece. It is entirely sheep oriented. 

## Compound follicles ##
The file bundles.pdf contains an analysis of the effect of secondary follicle bundle size on mean fibre diameter.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of how a sheep grows a fleece, of how various visually different fleece types occur, and whether one can infer backwards from fleece appearance to skin traits and fibre growth characteristics. This understanding is important in visual assessment of sheep, where measurement is neither practical nor economic.
