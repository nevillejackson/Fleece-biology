# Fleece-biology #
This project is about understanding  development of the skin , growth of wool fibres and formation of a fleece. It is entirely sheep oriented. 

## Fibre diameter and fibre length growth rate ##
The document diamlen.pdf is  a discussion document intended as a medium for setting research directions on the topic of what controls variation in fibre diameter between individual fibres within a fleece.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of how a sheep grows a fleece, of how various visually different fleece types occur, and whether one can infer backwards from fleece appearance to skin traits and fibre growth characteristics. This understanding is important in visual assessment of sheep, where measurement is neither practical nor economic.
