# Pre-papilla cell theory #
The subdirectory _pre-papilla-cells_ contains  an investigative writeup of numerical aspects of the pre-papila cell theory of follicle development.

## Software ##
Software used for this numerical investigation of pre-papilla cell dynamics is written in R and is available as an R package in subdirectory _ppcell_

## Work needed ##
The dynamics of the pre-papilla cell population and the way they form follicles is a difficult topic. There are a lot of variables and we do not fully understand how they are interrelated.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of how a sheep grows a fleece, of how various visually different fleece types occur, and whether one can infer backwards from fleece appearance to skin traits and fibre growth characteristics. This understanding is important in visual assessment of sheep, where measurement is neither practical nor economic.
