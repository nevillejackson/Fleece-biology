# Cortex structure #
The subdirectory _cortexstructure_ contains a theoretical study  of how ortho/para cortex structure of a wool fibre affects intrinsic fibre curvature. It is based on the Timoshenko equation which describes the change in curvature of a bimetal strip when heated.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of how the proportions of otho and para cortex and their respective elastic properties, affect the intrinsic curvature of a wool fibre.
