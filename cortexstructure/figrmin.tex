  \caption{A curved length of fibre with its radius of curvature centred at point $C$. The para cortex is the yellow segment, and its length is shown as the dotted centreline length $l_{p}$. The orthocortex is the blue segment and its length is shown as the dotted centreline length $l_{o}$. The radius of the inner edge of the curved fibre is $r$. The angle subtended at the centre of itsradius of curvature is $\theta$.}
