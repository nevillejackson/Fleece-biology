# Fleece-biology #
This project is about understanding  development of the skin , growth of wool fibres and formation of a fleece. It is entirely sheep oriented. 

## Crimp formation  ##
The subdirectory _crimpformation_ contains a theoretical study of crimp formation in Merino sheep. It rejects all former theories of crimp formation. It recognizes two types of crimp which are found in Australian Merinos, called _stretched helix_ and _unfolded helix_ and details how these form and the consequences for the relatioship of fibre length to staple length.

## Staple formation ##
The subdirectory _stapleformation contains a work in progress  which investigates the extent to which we can predict the type of staple structure which will form given certain skin traits and fibre growth parameters.

## Fibre curvature ##
The subdirectory _fibrecurvature_ contains a study of whether intrinsic fibre curvature can be predicted from follicle curvature score

## Cortex structure ##
The subdirectory _cortexstructure_ contains a theoretical study  of how ortho/para cortex structure of a wool fibre affects intrinsic fibre curvature. It is based on the Timoshenko equation which describes the change in curvature of a bimetal strip when heated.

## Skin space ##
The subdirectory _skinspace_ contains an exploration of the idea that secondary follicle development at 100 days is responsible for the excessive expansion of the area of the dermal layer of skin tissue which is one of the prerequisites for wrinkle or fold formation.

## Collagen study ##
The subdirectory _collagen_ contains a  link to a study of the role of soft and hard collagen in the dermis in wrinkle formation, follicle development and fibre growth. 

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of how a sheep grows a fleece, of how various visually different fleece types occur, and whether one can infer backwards from fleece appearance to skin traits and fibre growth characteristics. This understanding is important in visual assessment of sheep, where measurement is neither practical nor economic.
