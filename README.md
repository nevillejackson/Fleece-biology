# Fleece-biology #
This project is about understanding  development of the skin , growth of wool fibres and formation of a fleece. It is entirely sheep oriented. 

## Crimp formation  ##
The subdirectory _crimpformation_ contains a theoretical study of crimp formation in Merino sheep. It rejects all former theories of crimp formation. It recognizes two types of crimp which are found in Australian Merinos, called _stretched helix_ and _unfolded helix_ and details how these form and the consequences for the relatioship of fibre length to staple length.

## Staple formation ##
The subdirectory _stapleformation contains a work in progress  which investigates the extent to which we can predict the type of staple structure which will form given certain skin traits and fibre growth parameters.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of how a sheep grows a fleece, of how various visually different fleece types occure, and whether one can infer backwards from fleece appearance to skin traits and fibre growth characteristics. This understanding is important in visual assessment of sheep, where measurement is neither practical nor economic.
