# Crimp formation  #
The subdirectory _crimpformation_ contains a theoretical study of crimp formation in Merino sheep. It rejects all former theories of crimp formation. It recognizes two types of crimp which are found in Australian Merinos, called _stretched helix_ and _unfolded helix_ and details how these form and the consequences for the relatioship of fibre length to staple length.

## File structure ##
The file crimp.pdf is the file to download to obtain the main crimp structure document. It is built from crimp.tex and associated files.

The subdirectory _supplement_ contains a supporting document crimpmeas.pdf which is built from crimpmeas.tex. It contains an analysis of detailed measurements of amplitude and wavelength of crimp in single fibres.
