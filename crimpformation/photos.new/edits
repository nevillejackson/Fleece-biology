fig12		cropped left edge to remove what I think is a bubble
 		rotated so fibres horizontal like fig13
fig13		no edit
fig14		sharpened and angle=90
fig17		is now the wool photo only
fig18		unaligned, stretched and unfolded are 3 parts of one figure
		Had to constrain  each part to scale=0.33 to fit all 3 on a                     page.  

THe issue of what magnification ends up on the printed page has not been dealt with. The nominal 25x is what is seen in the eyepiece ( or camera) of the microscope. The .jpg image from the camera comes at resolution 2592 x 1944 pixels. This can change if it is cropped or rotated. This can display at any size, depending on the software used to display it on screen or paper.
 
Need an image of a graduated slide to work out final magnification on paper.
