  \caption{Plots of measured fibre length  against predicted mean fibre length using Method 2 with predictions based on measurement of wavelength and amplitude by the SF technique, and crimps per staple calculated by equation ~\ref{eqn:T}, but using relaxed fibre length ($L_{r}$) instread of staple length. Fibre lengths for the unfolded crimp type wools were adjusted for the effect of twist at the points of inflection using $H = 0.5 * amplitude$ and $R = 0.10 mm$ in the prediction equations }
