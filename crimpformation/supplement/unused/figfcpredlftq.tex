  \caption{Plots of measured fibre length against predicted mean fibre length using Method 3 with predictions based on measurement of wavelength and amplitude by the {\em fibre-mount} technique, and crimps per staple calculated by equation ~\ref{eqn:T}. Fibre lengths for the unfolded crimp type wools were adjusted for the effect of twist at the points of inflection using $H = 0.5 * amplitude$ and $R = 0.10 mm$ in equation ~\ref{eqn:lf}.}
