# Skin space #
The subdirectory _skinspace_ contains an exploration of the idea that secondary follicle development at 100 days is responsible for the excessive expansion of the area of the dermal layer of skin tissue which is one of the prerequisites for wrinkle or fold formation.

## Follicle tissue area ##
We develop an estimate of area of follicle tissue per mm^2 of skin, and partition it into primary follicle tissue and secondary follicle tissue.
We look  for evidence that amount of secondary follicle tissue  is a factor in wrinkle development.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of how a sheep grows a fleece, of how various visually different fleece types occur, and whether one can infer backwards from fleece appearance to skin traits and fibre growth characteristics. This understanding is important in visual assessment of sheep, where measurement is neither practical nor economic.
