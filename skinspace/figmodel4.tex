  \caption{Physical model with a 50mm strip of leather clamped at 0mm and 120 to a board at positions 0 and 50mm. The leather represents dermis. The board represents subdermal tissue. This demonstrates fold formation when the leather strip has 70mm of expansion (over the original 50mm), a 140 percent expansion.}
