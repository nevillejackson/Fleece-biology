# Staple formation #
The subdirectory _stapleformation contains a work in progress  which investigates the extent to which we can predict the type of staple structure which will form given certain skin traits and fibre growth parameters.

## Crimp Type prediction part I ##
The subdirectory _crimptype1_ contains part 1 of a 2 part study of prediction of crimp type from visual characteristics observable on the sheep

## Crimp Type prediction part II ##
The subdirectory _crimptype2_ contains part 2 of a 2 part study of prediction of crimp type from visual characteristics observable on the sheep

## Skin traits and staple structure latent variable analysis ##
The subdirectory _skin.stapstruct_ contains a study of the latent variables involved in the covariance between skin traits, wool growth traits,  and staple structure

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of the factors involved in staple formation during growth of a fleece. An assessment of whether visual staple characteristics can be used to infer skin properties and wool growth parameters.
