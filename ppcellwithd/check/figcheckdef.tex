	\caption{Two relationships between check (C) and cross sectional area (A) implied by defining check as $C = \frac{A_{B} - A}{A_{B}}$. For the redline $A_{B}$ is set to 1256.6 (40 microns diameter), and this corresponds to zero check. For the green line $A_{B}$ is set to 706. (30 microns diameter), and this corresponds to zero check. Both lines intersect the X-axis at (1,0)}
