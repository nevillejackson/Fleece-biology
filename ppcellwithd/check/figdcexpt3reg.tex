  \caption{Plot of breed means for reciprocal of follicle density and fibre cross sectional area from Daly and Carter(1956)~\cite{daly:56} experiment 3.  The red lines are linear regressions  with zero intercept fitted to breed means for period 1 (lowest liveweight). The green lines are linear regressions with zero intercept fitted to breed means for period 10 (higher liveweight and older).}
