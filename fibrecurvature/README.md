# Fibre curvature #
The subdirectory _fibrecurvature_ contains a study of whether intrinsic fibre curvature can be predicted from follicle curvature score

## Follicle curvature ##
Follicle curvature score is an assessment of how much follicles are curved in the skin on a scale of 1 to 7, when viewed in 3 dimensions in a thick vertiocal skin section. 

Intrinsic fibre curvature is the curvature of the fibre at the point where it emerges from the skin, before it is subjected to any of the forces of staple crimp formation. A relaxed fibre will always resume this curvature, provided it has not been hyperextended. 

We hypothesize that the above two curvatures are the same, so that one can convert from one to the other with just a change of scale.

## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
A way of obtaining intrinsic fibre curvature which is free of any forces which might bias the observed curvature of a fibre.
